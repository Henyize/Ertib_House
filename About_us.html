                        <p>But we are not just a restaurant, we are also a cafe, where you can experience the Habesha
                            coffee ceremony, a core cultural custom in Eritrea and Ethiopia. The coffee ceremony is a
                            ritual of serving coffee daily, mainly for the purpose of getting together with relatives,
                            neighbors, or other visitors. It involves roasting, grinding, and brewing the coffee beans
                            over an open flame, and pouring the coffee into small cups from a height. The coffee is
                            accompanied by a small snack, such as popcorn, peanuts, or himbasha, a traditional bread.
                            The coffee ceremony is a symbol of hospitality, friendship, and respect, and we invite you
                            to join us in this unique and enjoyable tradition.</p>
